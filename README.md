This project provides a model of a course selection service where choosing a specific course from a specific 
university allows a student to see the top-rated professors for teh class along with student suggestions all on 
one page. This project sought to tackle the problem of websites like RateMyProfessor where students have to 
open a large variety of tabs when evaluating different professors. In addition, sometimes the websites do not 
display all the classes the professor taught showing only the classes they are rated in. This service would 
hope to display all the classes. No data was scraped in the creation of this project being custom-made in an 
Excel spreadsheet locally.
